## Getting Started with NGINX

These are the example files for my course `Getting Started with NGINX` at Pluralsight.

## `nginx.org` files

- `nginx.org` static website files are pre-built and available as a release:
    - https://github.com/g0t4/course-nginx-gs/releases
- Based on sources at https://hg.nginx.org/nginx.org/
  - License: https://nginx.org/LICENSE
- See [./static/nginx_org](./static/nginx_org) for my build script
    - Mostly via [Dockerfile](./static/nginx_org/Dockerfile)
    - This is not an official build script, I guessed/hacked this together
